# `mnemonic` — per-tab reference

The `mnemonic` tab is the largest and most-used surface of the GUI:
**30 subcommands** spanning bundle emission and verification, format
conversion, watch-only wallet export and import, descriptor building
and restore, xpub-search, address derivation, BIP-85 child derivation,
BIP-39 last-word completion, Coldcard-compatible seed-XOR splitting,
SLIP-0039 and codex32 (BIP-93) K-of-N share-splitting, SeedQR
encode/decode, Nostr and silent-payment derivation, message
verification, address decoding, cost comparison, and card
inspection / repair / Electrum decryption. The GUI exposes each
subcommand as its own form on the same tab; the subcommand selector at
the top of the form switches between them.

## Subcommand index

The 30 subcommands group naturally into eight families. Each entry
deep-links to the subcommand's chapter; read any chapter end-to-end
for its form-shape diagram, per-flag reference, and worked example.

- **Bundle emission and verification.** The headline three-card
  workflow.
  - [`mnemonic bundle`](#mnemonic-bundle)\index{mnemonic bundle} —
    emit one `ms1` + one or more `mk1` + one `md1` from a master seed
    plus optional cosigner xpubs.
  - [`mnemonic verify-bundle`](#mnemonic-verify-bundle)\index{mnemonic verify-bundle}
    — round-trip a card set: re-emit from `ms1` (+ optional cosigner
    inputs) and assert a byte-identical match.
  - [`mnemonic restore`](#mnemonic-restore) —
    reconstruct a wallet (and, for keyless templates, complete it from
    your own seed) from an `md1` descriptor card.
- **Format conversion and wallet export/import.** The non-bundle
  output and intake paths.
  - [`mnemonic convert`](#mnemonic-convert)\index{mnemonic convert} —
    convert one secret-or-public input to one or more public outputs.
  - [`mnemonic export-wallet`](#mnemonic-export-wallet)\index{mnemonic export-wallet}
    — emit a watch-only wallet descriptor for Sparrow / Specter / etc.

The eight families above describe what each subcommand *does*, not what
its form looks like in the GUI. Each subcommand is documented on its own
with form-shape diagrams, per-flag reference, and at least one worked
example.

## Form shape — what every subcommand has in common

All 30 subcommands render through the same form scaffolding described in
chapter 31: a top-of-form pinned-version label with a subcommand
selector ComboBox and per-subcommand `?` help-icon; per-flag widgets
(text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, number spinners, path fields,
repeating-row editors, slot editors); a `Slot rows:` section if the
subcommand accepts the `--slot` repeating flag (currently `bundle`,
`verify-bundle`, `export-wallet`, `restore`, `build-descriptor`, and
`import-wallet`); an action bar with **Copy command (POSIX)**, **Copy
command (Windows)**, and **Run** buttons; an always-on `Preview:` line.

**Most** of the 30 subcommands consume secret-bearing inputs at
realistic form fillings — a master `ms1`, a `--passphrase`, a `--share`,
a `--from` whose chosen node is in the secret class (`phrase`,
`entropy`, `xprv`, `wif`, `ms1`, `bip38`, `electrum-phrase`,
`seedqr`), or a `--decrypt-password`. Under the `should_confirm_run`
predicate at `mnemonic-gui/src/secrets.rs` (any `secret: true` flag
value, any secret-class slot subkey, any secret-class NodeValueComposite
node), each fires the run-confirm modal under at least one valid form
input. The watch-only / public-only subcommands (`export-wallet` with
xpub-only slots, `decode-address`, `verify-message`, the
`xpub-search-*` family on public inputs) are the ones most likely to
fire **Run** without the modal in practice. The threat-model coverage in
[§14 Defense 2](#secret-handling) — the `••••` modal redaction and the
recommended cold-node operational mitigation — applies to **every**
secret-bearing invocation under this tab.

## Worked-example seed convention

Every chapter under this tab uses a canonical public test vector — the
12-word all-`abandon` phrase
`abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about`
or the 24-word `abandon × 23 + art` master where a longer seed is
required. These phrases are **public** and any wallet derived from them
has been swept by chain watchers since 2017 — their use in the manual is
for round-trip demonstration only. Each chapter that uses a test phrase
opens with a `:::danger` admonition restating this; do not engrave or
fund any wallet derived from them.

## Where to read next

If you are following the cycle from chapter 30 (the tour), pick a
subcommand from the index above and read its chapter end-to-end. If you
arrived via a `?` help-icon click in the GUI, you are already at the
right anchor; scroll up for the chapter outline, down for the per-flag
detail. Cross-references between chapters are explicit (`see [`mnemonic
bundle`](#mnemonic-bundle)`) and deep-link into the per-flag anchors
where relevant.
